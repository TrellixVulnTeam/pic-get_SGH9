# pic-get

This is an application called Pic-get. Originally I am going to make an application that can transfer photos to Ukiyoe style, but the result is not good, Therefore I have changed my idea to impressionism.

At first I want to make a upload system that the user can upload photos to internet and Pic-get can get the link of the photo and automatically process the photo into impressionism style. However, things didn't work in that way. I only can make two separate system and can't figure out the way to combine them together. So in the github there are the codes of those two system.

In case you haven't watch my introduction yet, here's the link:
